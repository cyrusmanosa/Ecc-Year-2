[2023/11/17, 1:16:20.727 PM] Description: High-performance mail transport agent
[2023/11/17, 1:16:20.727 PM]  Postfix is Wietse Venema's mail transport agent that started life as an
[2023/11/17, 1:16:20.727 PM]  alternative to the widely-used Sendmail program.  Postfix attempts to
[2023/11/17, 1:16:20.727 PM]  be fast, easy to administer, and secure, while at the same time being
[2023/11/17, 1:16:20.727 PM]  sendmail compatible enough to not upset existing users. Thus, the outside
[2023/11/17, 1:16:20.727 PM]  has a sendmail-ish flavor, but the inside is completely different.
